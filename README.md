  <h3> Hey, you can call me Faint!</h3>
</p

I'm a programmer who is interested in open source projects, linux system administration, low-level programming, competitive programming, and making my own projects.
I tend to find myself more interested in more of the lower spectrum of programming. This can consist of how compilers work, virtualization of hardware, operating systems, and how to create games in a language like C.

Most of the programming I'm currently doing is in Java and C, but I can code in Python and C# if needed. Below you will find a list of my technologies I use and what I'm up to. Thanks for visiting!
